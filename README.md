# Intel-Exploration-Parallel-Programming-TBB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have described specifically the Intel unique techniques in these files and some connections with my research projects. Please give me some comments if I have any mistake. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: I have tried to explore a number of files which have been useful with my own projects and works. All files have been re-coded carefully by basing on the Intel technical framewrok of original files, however I have tried to modify some parts sometime in order to satisfy my personal demands. Therefore there is any problem related to coding technique when you try to test them in your system, please check the Intel original files.
